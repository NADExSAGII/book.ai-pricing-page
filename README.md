What It Is:
HTML Structure: A series of div elements structure the content into a title, plan options, and action buttons. Each plan has a name, price, a list of features, and a button for user interaction.
CSS Styling: The design is clean and card-like, with a layout that adapts to different screen sizes (responsive design). Styling includes padding, borders, shadows, and hover effects to enhance the user experience.
How It Works:
Flexbox Layout: The plans are arranged side by side on larger screens and stack vertically on smaller screens, thanks to the flexbox model.
Responsive Design: Media queries ensure the section looks good on any device, from desktops to mobile phones.
Interactivity: Buttons change appearance on hover, encouraging users to click and sign up for a plan.
